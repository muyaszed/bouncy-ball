# Bouncy ball

This is a small app showcasing a basic physics concept on a bouncing ball. When a user click anywhere inside the frame, a ball will be projected with a random speed and an random direction. It will bounce and slow down each time it hits either four side of the screen, and eventually stops.

The main idea behind this is to provide a value that could reduce the ball velocity each time it collides and bounce untill it reach 0.
